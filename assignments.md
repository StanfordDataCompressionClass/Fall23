All assignments roughly cover 4 lectures, are released after the 2nd lecture and are due in 2 weeks. HWs will also be accessible
through this [link](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/homeworks/coverpage.html).

More project details and descriptions will be released at this [link](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/projects.html) in the future. 

**Late Day Policy**: 
everyone is given two late-days by default, communicate with teaching-staff via ED to avail them.
Note: late-days will not apply to final project presentation and report! Make sure you have the times blocked in your calendar.
