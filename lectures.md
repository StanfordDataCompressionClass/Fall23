You can find the relevant lecture links here. A **tentative** lecture plan is detailed below. We will add more details as the course progresses. In particular, recorded lecture videos will be available through Panopto Course Videos tool in Canvas. 

Working draft of the lecture notes are available [here](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/contents.html). We have also released a [tutorial](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/scl_tutorial/SCL_tutorial.html) on how to use the [Stanford Compression Library](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library).
