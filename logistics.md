### Disclaimer
Video cameras located in the back of the room will capture the instructor
presentations in this course. For your convenience, you can access these
recordings by logging into the course Canvas site. These recordings might be
reused in other Stanford courses, viewed by other Stanford students, faculty, or
staff, or used for other education and research purposes. Note that while the
cameras are positioned with the intention of recording only the instructor,
occasionally a part of your image or voice might be incidentally captured. If you
have questions, please contact a member of the teaching team.


## Course elements and grading (tentative)
EE 274 is a `3 unit` course - auditing allowed with instructor permission. The graded course elements include:

- `4` assignments with both theoretical and programming components (`15%` each)
- Short quizzes after every lecture, due before next (`10%`)
- final project (`30%`)
- [bonus] participation in the course (`5%`)

### Audit Policy
Audits are more than welcome! All the material is released via website.
Please contact instructors via the staff mailing list to get access to quizzes and HW submissions.
For Stanford students taking the course for `CR/NC`, we do require that you get 50% of the total grade to get a `CR`.

## Prerequisites
Basic probability and programming background (EE178, CS106B or equivalent), or instructorâ€™s permission. Background in statistical signal processing (EE278) and in information theory (EE276) may be helpful for appreciating some of the material, but is not assumed and the relevant background will be covered in class. Some of the final projects will be tailored to the students' backgrounds. 

## Reading Material
There is no required textbook. Lecture notes and slides will be provided as relevant. Working notes draft can be found
[here](https://stanforddatacompressionclass.github.io/notes/contents.html). We might also provide references to textbooks from time to time for additional reading.
